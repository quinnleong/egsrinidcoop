Yeah, I stole the source code for this. The NYTimes say it'll only be free "initially", and that sucks and totally goes against the spirit of the game as made originally. Also, the license said it was free to "use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose" so... great! I'll have to update the chosen answers (which, if you don't want to spoil them for yourself, don't look in the .js file) eventually, but for now this works.
